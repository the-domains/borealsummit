Hi, my name is Inaki.

I was born in MÃ©xico. Grew up with Mexico's folklore, music and exquisite food but I dreamt of more, I dreamt of galactic society.

My interests are as diverse as the universe, robotics and food but the main tool to access all of them is an analytical mind. I love thinking and brainstorming ideas.

I am currently a web software engineering and love to hear about new discoveries in every science domain.
