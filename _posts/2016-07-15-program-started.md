Hi, my name is Inaki.

I was born in MÃ©xico. Grew up with Mexico's folklore, music and exquisite food but I dreamt of more, I dreamt of galactic society.

My interests are as diverse as the universe, robotics and food but my main interest is knowledge and analytical thinking. Let's brainstorm ideas together.

I 'm currently a web software engineer and love to hear about new discoveries in every science domain.
